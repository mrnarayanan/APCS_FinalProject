************Pokemon Battle************
By: Murugan Narayanan and Colin Jensen

This game is a Pokemon battling game, similar to the online Pokemon Showdown by Smogon University. The player and the CPU are given 6 random Pokemon of a unique type. Only the player may substitute Pokemon. It is up to you to be aware of type advantage and disadvantage to maximize the damage you inflict on the opposing Pokemon. Pokemon have two types of attack: Physical and Special. Physical attacks make physical contact with the opponent, while Special Attacks are ranged attacks. Each Pokemon has two of each. Defense and Special Defense stats protect against each respective attack type, so be aware of each Pokemon's stats as you battle. The first one to defeat all 6 of their opponent's Pokemon wins!

To begin, please run AL.java

Enjoy!
